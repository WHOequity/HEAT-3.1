<h3><a id="1. Background" name="1. Background"></a>1. Background</h3>

<p>In the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) era, the world has committed to &ldquo;leave no-one behind.&rdquo; This requires a continuing focus on equity, reflected across multiple SDG goals and targets. Health inequality monitoring is critical to understand many aspects of who is being left behind (and where): it can identify differences in health indicators between different population subgroups. This is essential for the development of equity-oriented interventions, especially those on the path to universal health coverage. It can serve as the basis for the design and re-orientation of rights-based, gender-responsive and equitable health systems.</p>

<p>The Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) allows you to assess within-country health inequalities across countries. You can use the built-in <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HE-1540?lang=en" target="_blank">WHO Health Equity Monitor database</a> (2019 update) to explore inequalities in one country of interest and compare inequalities in that country with the situation in other countries. Disaggregated data and summary measures of inequality are presented in a variety of interactive ways, including tables and graphs.</p>

<p>For more information about the data displayed in HEAT, please refer to the technical notes.</p>

<p>The standalone version of HEAT can be used on all computers with a Windows or Macintosh operating system. In order to open the standalone version on your device, you require the &ldquo;R&rdquo; statistical software and a web browser. In the standalone package, WHO has provided a portable version of &ldquo;R&rdquo; and the portable edition of the web browser Google Chrome. This does not imply in any manner that the use of these products is endorsed or recommended by the World Health Organization in preference to others of a similar nature. R Portable and Chrome Portable do not require any installation.</p>

<h3><a id="3.2 Explore Inequality" name="3.2 Explore Inequality"></a>3.2 Explore Inequality</h3>

<p>Under <strong>Explore Inequality</strong>, you can assess the situation within a country of interest. Inequalities can be explored using disaggregated data in graphs (<em>Disaggregated data (graphs) </em>tab), detailed bar graphs (<em>Disaggregated data (detailed bar graphs) </em>tab), maps (<em>Disaggregated data (maps)</em> tab) and tables (<em>Disaggregated data (tables)</em> tab) as well as using summary measures of inequality in graphs (<em>Summary measures (graphs) </em>tab) and tables (<em>Summary measures (tables) </em>tab). Note that multiple countries may not be viewed at a single time in the Explore Inequality tab, as the intent of HEAT is to focus on within-country inequalities. Benchmarking may be done, however, using the Compare Inequality tab.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for exploring inequality</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Whether looking at disaggregated data or summary measures in table or graph form, it is recommended to start exploring inequality by selecting one health indicator and one dimension of inequality at a time &ndash; rather than selecting multiple health indicators and multiple dimensions of inequality.</li>
	<li>It is not recommended to visualize favourable health intervention and adverse health outcome indicators together on one graph. The interpretation of these is different: for favourable health interventions, a high value is desirable (meaning high coverage), while for adverse health outcomes, a low value is preferred (meaning low burden).</li>
	<li>When looking at multiple indicators together on one graph, it may be difficult to assess the situation correctly if there is a large difference in health levels between the indicators. For example, when looking at two health intervention indicators, one with high coverage and one with low coverage, they will both be visualized on the same scale covering a large range of values. This may make it difficult to discover smaller variations in coverage for each indicator. In situations like this, it may be a good idea to look at each indicator individually before visualizing them together on one graph.</li>
	<li>It is not recommended to compare subnational regional inequality over time if the number of subnational regions differs from one time to another.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="3.2.1 Disaggregated data (graphs)" name="3.2.1 Disaggregated data (graphs)"></a>3.2.1 Disaggregated data (graphs)</h4>

<div><strong>What you see</strong></div>

<p>The graph presents health data for population subgroups in a selected country of interest. By default, a (horizontal) line graph is displayed showing subgroup estimates (on the x-axis) for each survey year (on the y-axis). Alternatively, a (vertical) bar graph can be displayed showing subgroup estimates (on the y-axis) for each survey year (on the x-axis). If more than one health indicator and dimension of inequality are selected at the same time, multiple graphs are shown &ndash; one for each indicator and dimension.</p>

<p>In line graphs, coloured shapes indicate population subgroups &ndash; each health indicator for each survey year is represented on the graph by multiple coloured shapes (one for each subgroup representing a dimension of inequality). Black horizontal lines indicate the difference between minimum and maximum subgroup estimates.</p>

<p>In bar graphs, coloured bars indicate population subgroups &ndash; each health indicator for each survey year is represented on the graph by multiple coloured bars (one for each subgroup representing a dimension of inequality). Numbers above bars indicate the respective subgroup estimates. 95% confidence intervals for each subgroup estimate can be displayed in the form of vertical lines (or whiskers).</p>

<p><strong>How to explore</strong></p>

<p>Hover over a shape or bar to see additional information about the data point, including about the country, source, year, subgroup, population share of the subgroup, subgroup estimate, 95% confidence intervals of the subgroup estimate and national average.</p>

<div><strong>What you see</strong></div>

<p>The graph presents a selected summary measure of inequality for a selected country of interest. By default, a bar graph is displayed showing summary measure estimates (on the y-axis) for each survey year (on the x-axis). Alternatively, a line graph can be displayed. If more than one health indicator and dimension of inequality are selected at the same time, multiple graphs are shown &ndash; one line graph for each dimension of inequality and one bar graph for each indicator and dimension. In bar graphs, numbers above bars indicate the respective summary measure estimates. 95% confidence intervals for each summary measure estimate can be displayed in the form of vertical lines (or whiskers).</p>

<h3><a id="3.3 Compare Inequality" name="3.3 Compare Inequality"></a>3.3 Compare Inequality</h3>

<p>Under <strong>Compare Inequality</strong>, you can benchmark, i.e. compare the situation in one country with the situation in other countries. Benchmarking can be done using disaggregated data (<em>Disaggregated data (graphs) </em>tab) and summary measures of inequality (<em>Summary measures (graphs)</em> tab) in graphs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tips for comparing inequality</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>It is not recommended to compare subnational regional inequality across countries if the number of subnational regions differs between countries.</li>
